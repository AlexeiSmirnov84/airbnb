# Airbnb Seattle

Please enjoy to go through my Seattle AirBNB project.

You can read more about it on my blog: <a href=https://best-mahogany-dolphin-856.medium.com/insights-from-seattle-airb-b-d77224d7354c>my blog</a>.

The data shared by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle?select=listings.csv">Kaggle</a>

## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle AIRBNB data from Kaggle to understand the following questions:
Q1: What is the price should I set for my property?
Q2: What kind of amenities shall I include in my property and how they affect price?
Q3: How 'cleaning fee' depends on object size and price?Â¶
